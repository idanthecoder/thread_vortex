Hi! This is my 12 grade project, and my final high school project. The project takes inspiration from forum sites such as Reddit and Stackoverflow.

The project allows a vast number of users to engage in conversations varying in their contents.
Users can set up their online profile which others users can see, and they have to verify their email address with a verification code sent to their provided email address.
After setting up their profile and registering, the user will be able to see the newest conversations that other users have created. To load more conversation the user needs to scroll down. The user can enter conversations in order to see all the messages that were sent in that conversation, and also engage in that conversation. Messages are loaded automatically.
The user can search for conversation with a specific string, can up/down vote messages, can pin conversation in order to be able to get into them with ease, can edit/delete messages that he/she sent, can edit their profile data, can view their and other users profile page and also can change the order of loaded messages (alphabetically, chronologically, popularity).
